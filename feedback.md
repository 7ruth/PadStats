# Project 2 Evaluation
[rubric](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/blob/master/evaluation.md)

## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
>Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class. You came up to some creative solutions to get the map to work which is awesome.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

## Code Quality
**1: Progressing**
>Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc). You've got lots of files that aren't being used and could be removed. The ruby code for the most part looks pretty good, but the javascript is pretty bad - close to being unreadable. Check out an atom plugin in like 'atom beautify'

## Deployment and Functionality
**2: Performing**
>Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application. Planning should ideally be a living document and change as the project changes. User stories are almost like a todo list of features to complete. It's also really nice to have the main readme.md have information about purpose, usage, and directions to people that might want to contribute.
